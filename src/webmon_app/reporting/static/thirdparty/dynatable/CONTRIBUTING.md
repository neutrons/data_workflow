## Tests

Currently the testing process consists of opening [the Dynatable
documentation](http://os.alfajango.com/dynatable)
([source code
here](https://github.com/alfajango/alfajango.github.com/blob/master/_posts/2012-01-09-dynatable.md)) in
each browser and making sure every example works. This is fine for the
initial release, since it serves the dual purpose of helping us write
the documentation and having a written functional use-case at once.
However, one of the top priorities now is to automate each use-case in
the docs as a test case within an automated test suite.

If anyone out there thinks this sounds like fun, please contact me or
even go ahead and create an issue/pull request. Otherwise, it will be at
teh top of my priority list until I can get to it.
