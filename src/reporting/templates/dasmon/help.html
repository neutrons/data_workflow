The Web Monitor allows you to verify the health of the data aquisition and post-processing.

<h2><a href="#global_status" name="global_status">Global Status Page</a></h2>
<p>
The <a href='{{ global_status_url }}'>global status page</a> shows a list of all the instruments monitored by this system.
For each instrument, it shows a color-coded status for sub-systems.
</p>

    <table class="message_table">
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th style="min-width:100px">Instrument</th> <th>System status</th> <th>Processing completion</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody class='status_box'>
        <tr>
        <td>HYSA</td>
        <td>
            <ul>
                <li class='status_0'>DASMON</li> 
                <li class='status_0'>Workflow</li>
                <li class='status_0'>Catalog</li>

            </ul>

    </table>

<p>
The colored boxes indicate whether a system is alive and communicating correctly. 
If a system has a communication latency of more than 10 seconds, its condition will
go to yellow. A system is considered dead if it goes 15 minutes without communication.
The color for a dead system is red.
</p>

<h3>What to do when a process is no longer green</h3>
<ul>
   <li>If a system is yellow, watch it to see if it goes red. This is usually not a reason to call for support.</li>
   <li>If a system is red, call for support.</li>
   <li>Remember that a green system doesn't mean that there are no errors being produced. It only means that the
   system is alive.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The <i>Processing completion</i> column indicates whether the last three runs have completed processing
successfully. The condition will be red if the run before last has not completed. If it has completed
successfully but either of the two runs that preceded it did not, the condition will go to yellow.
A yellow condition indicates that the processing is currently healthy but it has recently failed.
</p>

<h3>What to do when the <i>Processing completion</i> is no longer green</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Watch the live run summary to see whether the problem disappears within a couple of runs. 
    If not, send an email for support. Do not call for support for this error outside of business hours.</li>
    <li>Check the error messages.</li>
    <li><b>REDUCTION RuntimeError: The proton charge is zero</b> is not an error condition that should be reported unless it persist for several runs.</li>
    <li>A yellow condition is not a reason to call for support unless the live run summary page shows that there
    has been multiple errors within the last 24 hours.</li>
</ul>
<br>


<h2><a href="#dasmon_live" name="dasmon_live">DAS Monitor Page</a> </h2>
<p>
The <a href='{{ hysa_live_monitor_url }}'>DAS monitor</a> shows the current status of the acquisition.
In addition to the system health information described above, it also shows the current run number and title, 
as well as the state of the acquisition (stopped, recording, or paused).

The table shows the process variables that are emitted by the monitoring system. Some variable names have
a link associated with them. Click on that link to see a plot of that variable's value over time.

The plot at the top of the page shows the number of <i>translated</i> runs and number of errors per hour created within 
the past 24 hours. Errors are shown in red on the plot.
<p>

<h3>What to do when there are errors on the plot</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The page shows the current IPTS number. Click on that link to go to the list of runs for that experiment.
    Runs with errors are clearly identified. Clicking on the link for those runs will give you more information.</li>
    <li>Sporadic errors are part of normal operation and might be due to a variety of factors. Contact support if
    there are as many errors as there are runs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What to do when there hasn't been a translated run in a while</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Only worry if the beam is ON.</li>
    <li>Only worry if you the instrument has been <b>Recording</b> within the period in question.</li>
    <li>If the current status is <b>Recording</b>, ask the users or the instrument scientist whether 
    they are set up to take long runs.</li> 
    <li>If the run number identified on the page as the "<i>last translated run</i>" is significantly different
    than the current run (displayed in larger font below the plot), call for support.</li>
</ul>
<br>


<h2><a href="#dasmon_runs" name="dasmon_runs">DAS Monitor Page: Live Runs</a> </h2>
<p>
A link at the top right of the DAS monitor page allows you
to switch back and forth between seeing the <a href='{{ hysa_live_monitor_url }}'>live process variables</a> 
or the <a href='{{ hysa_live_runs_url }}'>live run list</a>. The last column of the run list shows
whether a particular run has successfully gone through of the data processing. For a given run, the completion
can either be <span class='green'><b>complete</b></span> or <span class='red'><b>incomplete</b></span>.
</p>

<h3>What to do if runs are incomplete</h3>
<ul>
    <li>It's normal for the latest run to be incomplete for a little while.</li>
    <li>Clicking on the link for an incomplete run will give you more information.</li>
    <li>Run can occasionally be incomplete. This is usually do to failing auto-reduction. 
    Persistent reduction errors should be checked with the instrument scientist first.</li>
    <li><b>REDUCTION RuntimeError: The proton charge is zero</b> is not an error condition that should be reported unless it persist for several runs.</li>
</ul>
